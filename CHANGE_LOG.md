| enablePIPControl    | Enable a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) for the player  |


## üì¶ Setup for Picture-in-Picture (PiP)
**ü§ñ Android**

Before using PiP mode in your media player, you need to enable it in your app‚Äôs AndroidManifest.xml.

Add the following flags inside your <activity> (usually MainActivity):
```kotlin
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:supportsPictureInPicture="true"
    android:resizeableActivity="true"
    android:configChanges="screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|orientation|keyboardHidden"/>
```
**üì± iOS**

In Xcode, enable Background Modes capability.

Check ‚úÖ Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture.

# 1.0.45 [2025-08-26]
### Added
- wasmJs support added

## üåê Setup for wasmJs (WebAssembly)
To enable wasmJs support with Shaka Player, you need to include the supporting files shipped with this library.

All required files are available [here](./assets/wasmJs):

### Add Scripts in index.html
Make sure to add these scripts before your Compose WASM app (composeApp.js).

‚ö†Ô∏è The order matters: Shaka ‚Üí Global ‚Üí Helpers ‚Üí Compose app.
```kotlin
<!-- Shaka Player -->
<script src="shaka-player.compiled.js"></script>
<script src="shaka-global.js"></script>

<!-- WASM Helpers -->
<script src="shaka-wasm-helpers.js"></script>

<!-- Your Compose WASM app -->
<script src="composeApp.js"></script>
```

# 1.0.42 [2025-07-07]
## üì¶ Feature Migration Notice
The following features have been **moved to a new package** to support **all platforms (iOS, Android, Desktop):**
- **üìπ Video Preview Thumbnails**

- **üìè Retrieve Media Duration**

These features are now available in the full multiplatform package:
```kotlin
implementation("network.chaintech:media-frame-kit:1.0.0")
```
‚úÖ **What Remains in This Package**
This package still supports the above features on **Android** and **iOS** only:

**üìπ Video Preview**
```kotlin
VideoPreviewComposable(
    url = videoUrl,
    frameCount = 5,
    contentScale = ContentScale.Crop
)
```
**üìè Retrieve Media Duration**
```kotlin
RetrieveMediaDuration(
    url = videoUrl,
    onDurationRetrieved = { duration ->
        // Handle retrieved duration
    }
)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Desktop support has been removed in this package.


# 1.0.41 [2025-06-04]
### Added
- üßæ **Custom Headers:** Ability to pass custom headers with media URLs for AudioPlayer.

# 1.0.40 [2025-05-01]
### Added
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Fullscreen Support:** Added support for fullscreen mode on desktop. You can manually toggle between fullscreen and floating window modes using control buttons.

## üñºÔ∏è Cross-Platform Drawable Migration Guide
‚ö†Ô∏è **Background**
Previously, this library used `org.jetbrains.compose.resources.DrawableResource`, which is only available in Compose Multiplatform.
However, this causes compatibility issues when used in Android-only Compose projects, which don‚Äôt support `DrawableResource`.

To solve this, we‚Äôve introduced a new platform-agnostic abstraction: `PlatformDrawable`.

‚úÖ **Use per platform:**

**Android:** AndroidResourceDrawable(R.drawable.icon)

**Compose Multiplatform:** ComposeResourceDrawable(Res.drawable.icon)


## üìã Setup Guide for Fullscreen Support in Desktop
To enable fullscreen and window placement control from the library, you need to provide your app's WindowState using CompositionLocalProvider.

**For example:**
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    val windowState = rememberWindowState(width = 900.dp, height = 700.dp)
    CompositionLocalProvider(LocalWindowState provides windowState) {
        Window(
            title = "MediaPlayer",
            state = windowState,
            onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication,
        ) {
            MainView()
        }
    }
}
```
